# Dataset Release
We have created a huge synthetic training dataset SimRGBD-Franka (~hundreds of GB). For downloading conveniently, we divide the whole dataset into six parts: color.zip, mask.zip, ir.zip, depth_60.zip, simDepthImage.zip, and meta.zip. We could download the dataset from the webpage [website](https://mirrors.pku.edu.cn/dl-release/SGTAPose_CVPR2023)
